## Usage

1. **Login**: Select a user role (Admin, Manager, or Developer) on the login page
2. **View Projects**: Navigate to the Projects page to see all projects
3. **Create Projects**: Admins can create new projects
4. **Manage Tasks**: 
   - Managers can create tasks and assign them to developers
   - Developers can start, end, and complete assigned tasks
5. **View Users**: See all users and their roles on the Users page

## Data Persistence

All data is stored in browser localStorage with the following keys:
- `tm_users`: User data
- `tm_projects`: Project and task data
- `tm_current_user`: Currently logged-in user

On first load, the app seeds initial data with:
- 3 users (Admin, Manager, Developer)
- 1 sample project with 2 tasks

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **localStorage**: Client-side data persistence

## Development

The project follows clean code principles:
- Atomic permission functions
- Reusable components
- Type-safe operations
- Proper error handling
- Route protection
